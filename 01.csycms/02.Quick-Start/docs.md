# QuickStart

These are the options to get CSYCMS: (We see only one option for now. If you'd like to go any other way of installing, then you'll have to go it alone).

### From GitHub

We have created an [installation script](https://github.com/csymapp/csycms/blob/master/Install/installCsycms.sh) which you can use to install CSYCMS. 

```
cd /tmp
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csymapp/csycms/master/Install/installCsycms.sh
chmod +x installCsycms.sh
./installCsycms.sh
```

Then follow the installation instructions as directed by the script.

You will have to edit [some configurations](/csycms/Configuration)
